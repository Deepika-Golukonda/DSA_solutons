# 🧠 DSA Solutions (Python)

This repository contains my solutions for **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems written in Python.

## 📂 Folder Structure
- **Arrays** – Problems related to arrays (e.g., finding the second largest number)
- **Sorting** – Sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort
- **Searching** – Search algorithms like Linear Search and Binary Search
- **Strings** – String manipulation problems
- **LinkedList** – Linked list operations

## 🧩 How to Use
Each folder contains well-commented `.py` files with clear logic and test cases.  
You can open any file to view the solution and its explanation.

## 🚀 Future Updates
- More problems from LeetCode, GeeksForGeeks, and HackerRank  
- Time and space complexity analysis for each program  
- Problem statements and sample inputs/outputs
